The time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field reads
\begin{eqnarray}
    i \hbar \pdv{t} \Psi(\va*{r},t) = \Bigg\{ \frac{1}{2m} \Big[ -i \hbar \grad - \frac{q}{c} \va*{A}(\va*{r},t) \Big]^2 + q U(\va*{r},t) \Bigg\} \Psi(\va*{r},t)
\end{eqnarray}
where $U(\va*{r},t)$ and $\va*{A}(\va*{r},t)$ are the (real) scalar and vector potential, respectively, c is the speed of light, and $q$ is the charge of the particle.
Show that the probability density $\rho(\va*{r},t)$ and the probability current density $\va*{j}(\va*{r},t)$ are given in this case by
\begin{align}
    \rho(\va*{r},t) &= | \Psi(\va*{r},t) |^2 \\
    \va*{j}(\va*{r},t) &= \frac{\hbar}{2 m i} \Big[ \Psi^{*}(\va*{r},t) \grad \Psi(\va*{r},t) - \Psi(\va*{r},t) \grad \Psi^{*}(\va*{r},t) \Big] - \frac{q}{mc} \va*{A}(\va*{r},t) | \Psi(\va*{r},t) |^2
\end{align}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
    \pdv{t} \rho(\va*{r},t) + \div{\va*{j}(\va*{r},t)} = 0
.\end{eqnarray}

Consider a particle in a potential $V(\va*{r})$ with associated wave function satisfying the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation
\begin{eqnarray}
    i \hbar \pdv{t} \Psi(\va*{r},t) = \Big[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \laplacian + V(\va*{r}) \Big] \Psi(\va*{r},t)
.\end{eqnarray}

(a) Show that 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \dv{t} \expval{\va*{r}(t)} = \int \dd[3]{\va*{r}} \, \va*{j}(\va*{r},t)
,\end{eqnarray}
where $\expval{\va*{r}(t)}$ is the average position of the particle (notation as in notes) and $\va*{j}(\va*{r},t)$ is the probability current density.
Using the definition of $\va*{j}(\va*{r},t)$, show that the equation above can also be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
    m \dv{t} \expval{\va*{r}(t)} = \expval{\va*{p}(t)}
.\end{eqnarray}

(b) Show that 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \begin{aligned}
        \dv{t} \expval{\va*{p}(t)} &= - \expval{\grad{V}} = - \int \dd[3]{\va*{r}} \Psi^{*}(\va*{r},t) [\grad{V(\va*{r})}] \Psi(\va*{r},t) \\
                                   &= \int \dd[3]{\va*{r}} \Psi^{*}(\va*{r},t) \va*{F}(\va*{r}) \Psi(\va*{r},t)
    \end{aligned}
,\end{eqnarray}
where we have introduced the force $\va*{F}(\va*{r})$.

\textbf{Hint}: Consider, say, the $x$-component and, by using the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and its complex conjugate, obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
    \begin{aligned}
        \dv{t} \expval{p_{x}(t)} &= -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \int \dd[3]{\va*{r}} \Bigg[ (\laplacian{\Psi^{*}}) \pdv{\Psi}{x} - \Psi^{*} \laplacian{\pdv{\Psi}{x}} \Bigg] \\
                                 &+ \int \dd[3]{\va*{r}} \Bigg[ V \Psi^{*} \pdv{\Psi}{x} - \Psi^{*} \pdv{(V \Psi)}{x} \Bigg]
    ,\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray}
where the dependence on $\va*{r}$ and $t$ on the r.h.s. has been suppressed for brevity.
Next examine these two terms.

(c) The equation above looks like Newton's second law but for average values.
As a matter of fact if $\expval{\va*{F}} = \va*{F}(\expval{\va*{r}})$, then $\expval{\va*{r}(t)}$ changes in time as the position of a classical particle under the action of the force $\va*{F}(\va*{r})$.
Under what condition(s) can this happen?
Obtain $\expval{\va*{r}(t)}$ and $\expval{\va*{p}(t)}$ for a particle in a harmonic potential
\begin{eqnarray}
   V(\va*{r}) = \frac{m \omega^2}{2} \va*{r}^2
.\end{eqnarray}
